# A3_on_storms
An empty startpoint for tracking Assignment 3 collaborations and submissions

Haocong, I went ahead and outlined some basic functions we might need. I don't think this will actually be too
difficult to do. Maybe next step is to work out the tests that need to be in place? -Josh 6/23/18

The first part (distance moved by each storm) has been finished. I also used my code in Assignment 2 as the file
processor. I've added comment for every segment of code in it, but let me know if anything seems strange or you
want me to explain. The output will (and needs to) be improved, or at least explain what each element means.
This can be done after all three requirements are finished. -Haocong 6/24/18

I added a couple functions from the class notes that seemed helpful -josh 6/25

I reviewed those functions again. It seems that the flip direction and myLatLon functions are not necessary. As
stated in last class, there are no longer issues from the dataset so I don't think we need them for it anymore.
storm_distance is now outputing both distance and bearing and is named storm_distance_bearing
I'll take a look at 3 later tonight. Feel free to add anything for 2 and 3 if you wish to. 2 should be very easy.

Basic requirement for 3 should have been met at this time. It can be improved to make it better. I'll add comments
to those code later in the day. Some other improvements to the code as well. -Haocong 6/26 0:30

I updated the calculate hours function I resorted to datetime because it was taking too long to try to do
manually. I can work on the hpythosis test next. I think I understand what needs to be done there.-Josh 2am.

nvmd, I see you got that one. sorry, I got lost in the  weeds calculating hours. It looks like there is one function
remaining? I can take care of that. -Josh 2am
