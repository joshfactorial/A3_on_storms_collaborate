# A3_on_storms
An empty startpoint for tracking Assignment 3 collaborations and submissions

Haocong, I went ahead and outlined some basic functions we might need. I don't think this will actually be too
difficult to do. Maybe next step is to work out the tests that need to be in place? -Josh 6/23/18

The first part (distance moved by each storm) has been finished. I also used my code in Assignment 2 as the file
processor. I've added comment for every segment of code in it, but let me know if anything seems strange or you
want me to explain. The output will (and needs to) be improved, or at least explain what each element means.
This can be done after all three requirements are finished. -Haocong 6/24/18

I added a couple functions from the class notes that seemed helpful -josh 6/25
