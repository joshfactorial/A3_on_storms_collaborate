# A3_on_storms
An empty startpoint for tracking Assignment 3 collaborations and submissions

Haocong, I went ahead and outlined some basic functions we might need. I don't think this will actually be too
difficult to do. Maybe next step is to work out the tests that need to be in place? -Josh 6/23/18

The first part (distance moved by each storm) has been finished. I also used my code in Assignment 2 as the file
processor. I've added comment for every segment of code in it, but let me know if anything seems strange or you
want me to explain. The output will (and needs to) be improved, or at least explain what each element means.
This can be done after all three requirements are finished. -Haocong 6/24/18

I added a couple functions from the class notes that seemed helpful -josh 6/25

I reviewed those functions again. It seems that the flip direction and myLatLon functions are not necessary. As
stated in last class, there are no longer issues from the dataset so I don't think we need them for it anymore.
I also removed the bearing for storm_direction since the requirement doesn't seem to need it. It only asked for
distance travelled without direction. So I think it's not needed. I'll leave them as comments in case we need it
for the next two parts.
For now, I'll optimize the process file function and try to separate a few more functions from it. -Haocong 6/25 15:45
